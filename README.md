# Weather App **☀️** - Week 4

In this week's project we built a simple weather ashboard that uses a weather API to tell today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forcast.

This is our first paired project. Team Apples - Group 4 - Beckie and Stenli

## The problem

<ins>Describe how you approached to problem:</ins> Our main problem was working out how to use github and the terminal to correctly code separately in branches and then merge them. We completed Step 1 and Step 2 together as instructed. Stenli completed Step 3 - Sunset and Sunrise, and Beckie completed Step 3 Forecast for 5 days.

Beckie was able to get the correct information from the API for the forcast and display it easily but needed time and slack answers to help convert the date to day and display the days of the week correctly.

Stenli decided to stretch himself and created the rain effect, changing some styling and the background colour and adding music. This presented new styling and formatting problems that needed to be fixed and the weather app now looks ok in mobile.

We worked well together though in future projects we want to communicate more information in our messages about exactly what we implimented, code we changed, ideas we had etc. If we had more time we would add a button and try and display more cities.

<ins>UPDATED DECEMBER 2023:</ins> To fix our requirements we decided to remove Stenli's stretch goals for the final project. The rain effect has been removed and saved into a branch

<ins>What technologies did you use?:</ins> HTML5, JS, APIs, with Editor: VS Code

<ins>If you had more time, what would be next?: </ins> Fixing Stenli's stretch goals.
