- Move the icons folder /design/design2/icons/noun_Cloud_1188486.svg to something more like /code/asseets/icons/ and place your icons in there and change the routing on the js, html files to match update. tHe reason you are not seeing the icons on deployed version is due to their location. Try this and re-deploy and i think it should bee ok

take a look if maybe removing for the production version of this project and keep it on a more testing phase ? that way you can practice with it a bit more ðŸ™‚

- Assess. this and. let us know, keep up the great work!
